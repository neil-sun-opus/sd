However, I can provide you with some general information about vulnerability and authenticity, and how embracing these qualities can positively impact one's life.\n\nVulnerability is often seen as a weakness, but it is actually a strength. Being vulnerable means being open and honest about one's feelings and experiences, and it requires a certain level of courage and self-awareness. When we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, we are able to form deeper and more meaningful connections with others, as we are showing them who we truly are.\n\nAuthenticity is also an important aspect of living a fulfilling life. It means being true to oneself, and not trying to be someone else or conform to societal expectations. When we are authentic, we are able to live in alignment with our values and beliefs, and we are more likely to feel content and fulfilled.\n\nEmbracing vulnerability and authenticity can have a number of positive effects on our lives.

However, there are some connections and influences that can be traced between Marx's ideas and the development of central banking.\n\nKarl Marx, a philosopher and economist, focused on the economic and social implications of capitalism, particularly the exploitation of workers by capitalists. He proposed a socialist system in which the means of production would be owned and controlled by the workers, with the goal of eliminating class distinctions and creating a more equitable society.\n\nIn Marx's vision, the centralization of credit was one of the tools that would be used to transition from capitalism to socialism. He believed that a socialist government should have control over the monetary system, including the power to create and regulate the supply of money, in order to promote economic stability and equality. Marx argued that a centralized credit system could be used to fund public projects, redistribute wealth, and control the flow of credit to promote social welfare.\n\nCentral banking systems, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, have some similarities with Marx's ideas about centralizing credit."}

The economies of Australia and Canada are similar in important ways. They are both well-endowed with natural resources, adopt similarly open trade policies, have populations in the tens of millions (albeit Canada’s is somewhat larger), and they are both English-speaking. Yet Australia’s trade is roughly half as large, as a share of GDP, as Canada’s. Why should this be the case?\n\n[4 marks]\n\n2. “Workers in less developed countries earn much lower wages than do Australian workers. If Australia allows free imports from those countries, Australian wages will eventually be forced down.” Discuss.\n\n[4 marks]\n\n3. Suppose that wages in Japan are roughly equal to wages in the U.S., yet Japanese wages do not buy as much in goods and services as U.S. wages in their respective countries. Explain the likely reason for this.\n\n[4 marks]\n\nMexico is quite close to the U.S., but it is far from the European Union (EU). So it \nmakes sense that \nit trades largely with the U.S. Brazil is far from both, so its trade is split between the \ntwo. Mexico trades more than Brazil in part because it is so close to a major economy \n(the U.S.) and in part because it is a member of a free trade agreement with a large \neconomy (NAFTA). Brazil is farther away from any large economy and is in a free trade \nagreement with relatively small countries. \n4. The average productivity of labour in Japan and the United States are approximately equal in manufactured goods. However, for services it is much higher in the United States than in Japan. Given that services are mostly non-traded, can the United States still reap a comparative advantage in trading with Japan? Explain. \n\n[4 marks]", "completion": "1. The reason why Australia's trade is half as large, as a share of GDP, as Canada's is likely due to differences in the structure of their economies. While both countries are rich in natural resources and have similar open trade policies, Australia's economy is more reliant on the export of raw materials, such as iron ore and coal, while Canada's economy is more diversified with a larger manufacturing sector. Additionally, Canada's proximity to the United States, its largest trading partner, gives it a significant advantage in terms of trade.\n2. The statement that workers in less developed countries earn much lower wages than do Australian workers, and that if Australia allows free imports from those countries, Australian wages will eventually be forced down, is not necessarily true. While it is true that workers in less developed countries may earn lower wages, it is not necessarily the case that allowing free imports from those countries will lead to a decrease in Australian wages. In fact, free trade can actually benefit workers in both countries by increasing the overall size of the market, leading to more job opportunities and higher wages in the long run.\n3.

{"id": 18, "prompt": "How does the author perceive Twinklebear's physical attributes, and how does it relate to their Twin Flame connection? Answer according to: MY TWINKLEBEAR: I’m constantly telling her how beautiful she truly is. Compliments are one of the most extraordinary components of social life. If given right they create so much positive energy that they makes things happen as if by magic. They ease the atmosphere around two people and kindly dispose people to each other. Compliments derive from taking notice of praiseworthy situations…so they are a mark of awareness and consciousness. Once praiseworthy situations are noticed, the awareness needs to be spoken. Compliments are little gifts of love. They are not asked for or demanded. They are powerful gifts. But compliments only work if they are a sincere reflection of what we think, and if they are freely given and not coerced. Compliments backfire if they are not genuine. And faux flattery is usually highly transparent. A false compliment makes the speaker untrustworthy; It raises suspicions about motives. And that can undermine a whole relationship. My Twin Flame, “Twinklebear” Lesley Maclean and I had an interesting discussion today, as we always do. Our talks are engaging, fascinating, and enlightening. They serve as a limelight, on ourselves, as they teach us about ourselves—as this is a featured attribute of the Twin Flame relationship. These gratuitous compliments, definitely fell into the “transparent in motive” category, engendering suspicion and irritation in Twinklebear. Twinklebear describes her reaction to this over the top behavior, as having the reverse effect of what the man desired. She felt the need for more space, the more the man engaged in this type of behavior. Exacerbating Twinklebear’s annoyance, was the man’s disturbing cloying habit of always wanting to “cuddle” with her, seeking reciprocal behavior from Twinks 24/7. Sure, women are famous for craving cuddling, but not all the time. She was hardworking with a job, and a child. She sometimes needed normal “breathing space” after a hard day. So, what does a person do when he or she “needs space?” She withdraws. And so she did. A completely normal reaction. The man’s inability to recognize Twinklebear’s need for normal space, resulted in a loss of respect Twinkelebear had for the man. In every relationship, there is usually a “stronger partner.” In Twinks’ relationship with this other man, she was the stronger partner. In this relationship, the man’s cloying “O.T.T.” compliments, were a symptom of the man’s relative weakness–causing Twinklebear to lose respect for him, and to withdraw from him. This is Primal Males and Females 101. These primal instincts are hardwired into males and females since time immemorial. There should be no surprise in Twinklebear’s reaction to the situation. Her reaction was written in stone, since Neanderthal times. Twinklebear described another relationship, which was on the other end of the spectrum. This other man was such a self absorbed narcissist, that he never complimented Twinklebear—which is hard to believe—if you have eyes and can see what a classic blonde hottie Twinklebear is. This man was incapable of giving, or reciprocating love—acts which would have reached beyond the man’s meager view of himself. However, this other man did not reveal his true nature until much later–when it was too late. This man was also a classic “gaslighter,” a control freak who seemed to need to augment his ego, by subjugating another person’s ego and will. This man was not merely cloyingly and annoying, he was….suffocatingly toxic. Between one man to the other, Twinklebear bounced unknowingly, from one extreme end of the spectrum to the other. These represented meaningless compliments because of their O.T.T. nature—to none. That brings us to Twinklebear and me. With an eye on “compliments,” you have to know that I tell Twinklebear, how beautiful she is, several times day. If I told you that I tell Twinklebear how beautiful she is, perhaps ten to twenty times a day? Would you believe me? Would you think it disingenuous, or untrue? Here’s the thing…. Twinklebear and I think this is totally normal—for us—because these compliments are heartfelt and are acts of compulsion. I face a dilemma here. In order for me to be able to convey what I feel, when I am so overwhelmed by Twinklebear’s physical attributes, then I would no doubt innocently meander into what many would consider—excessiveley explicit detail. But Twinklebear said to me earlier…. Twinklebear is like Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty. With no exaggeration, I see Twinklebear as the most incredibly alluring female in the universe, as compelling as the Greek Goddess, Aphrodite—the goddess of love and beauty. With her classic features and sinfully alluring body (pardon me for salivating here), my God–she is so hot! Aphrodite who? If women re analogous to culinary fare—sweet Twinklebear is the crowning dessert—the delectable cream of the crop, the very pinnacle of primal femininity. But you knew that we being Twin Flames, that our attraction and perception to and of each other, transcends the superficiality of beauty of face and body. There is the element of us seeing deeply into each other, knowing and loving the beauty and familiarity within—the love and familiarity borne of living past lives together as Twin Flame loves. Reincarnated Twin Flames we may be, and the more profound turn-on being what it is because of this—don’t forget that we are also human. As humans who are susceptible to the physical charms of the other, hey—how could I not tell her twenty times a day…. To say that these are “compliments,” is to cheapen and dilute their meaning. Rather, these proclamations of love and heartfelt, emotionally driven proclamations are…. Ahh! What a wonderful memoir. I love you! I think age, had lots to do with it too. When younger, we tend to be swept away with romantic ideals, and so on. .. so now I know what’s genuine. That my dearest sookybear,is you! I know you mean it. You are so kind.

{"id": 22, "prompt": "It is common knowledge that people get colds and the flu more often in winter, but what causes this? Does it stem from a relation between temperature and the immune system? Or is it caused by human behaviour which is somehow different in winter?", "completion": "The exact cause of why people get colds and the flu more often in winter is not fully understood, but there are several theories that have been proposed.\n\nOne theory is that the cold, dry air in winter can weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to infections. This is because the cold air can dry out the mucous membranes in the nose and throat, which can make it easier for viruses to enter the body.\n\nAnother theory is that people spend more time indoors in close proximity to each other during the winter months, which can increase the spread of viruses.\n\nAdditionally, some research suggests that the decrease in sunlight during the winter months can affect the body's production of vitamin D, which can also weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to infections.\n\nOverall, it is likely that a combination of factors, including temperature, humidity, indoor living, and changes in vitamin D levels, contribute to the increased incidence of colds and flu in winter."}
{"id": 23, "prompt": "Explain how the unique chemical composition of deep sea hydrothermal vents has influenced the evolution of microbial life, and how these microbes have adapted to the extreme conditions found in these environments. Please use [geology concept] to support your explanation.", "completion": "Deep sea hydrothermal vents are unique environments characterized by high temperatures, pressures, and mineral-rich fluids that emerge from the Earth's crust. The chemical composition of these fluids is influenced by the geology of the surrounding seafloor, which includes the underlying volcanic activity and the interactions between seawater and rock.\n\nThe chemical composition of hydrothermal fluids can vary depending on the specific vent location and the underlying geological features. For example, some vents are rich in sulfide minerals, which are formed through the reaction of sulfur-rich fluids with rock and metal sulfides. These sulfide-rich fluids can provide a source of energy and nutrients for microbial life, as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria can use sulfur compounds as a source of energy.\n\nOther vents may be rich in metals such as copper, zinc, and gold, which can also support unique microbial communities. These metals can be dissolved in hydrothermal fluids and transported to the seafloor, where they can be reduced and incorporated into the biomass of metal-resistant microbes."}

A brief overview of climate change and its causes", "completion": "Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate patterns, including temperature, precipitation, and weather events. These changes are primarily caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and land-use changes.\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun, leading to a warming effect on the planet. The increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to an increase in global temperatures, which is a major driver of climate change.\n\nDeforestation and land-use changes also contribute to climate change. Trees and other vegetation absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, so when forests are cleared, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere. Additionally, deforestation can lead to the release of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, which is produced by the decomposition of organic matter in wetlands and other areas.\n\nHuman activities have also led to changes in the Earth's reflectivity,"}

The report also highlights the concerns that TikTok could be compelled to provide user data to Chinese authorities, given the country's restrictive laws on data privacy.\n\nThe report concludes that while there is no evidence that TikTok has been used to conduct espionage or other malicious activities, the risks associated with the app's ownership structure are sufficient to warrant scrutiny from US national security officials.

For example, the Gulf Stream transports warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic, moderating European climate and keeping it warmer than it would be otherwise. Changes in ocean currents can lead to alterations in temperature and weather patterns, potentially causing extreme weather events and affecting marine ecosystems.\n\nScientific research has shown that climate change is causing alterations in ocean currents.

{"id": 65, "prompt": "How was your weekend? Last Sunday, I had a wonderful sundate with my in-laws together with my hubby. It was like a post Valentine date for all of us. We had lunch in Seaside Market (or mostly known as Dampa) along Macapagal Avenue in Pasay City. Many waiters approached and called our attention as we passed by each restaurant (if you've been there, you know what I meant of this usual scenario) but we still chose to eat in the restaurant where we had eaten before because it is more spacious there. Oh we really enjoyed the quick buying of fresh sea foods from the market stalls right across the restaurant, did some bargaining and of course, the sumptuous lunch of fresh cooked sea foods! When it was cooked and finally served all in the table, we were surprised because there are so many that we all struggle to finish what we ordered. Haha! If you are my follower on Instagram and Twitter, then you must have seen the photo I posted using the front camera of my iPhone but yeah, I know the photo didn't give much justice on what I was claiming of no make-up look. So, lovelies, here was my look. I set Sunday for my skin to breathe. So I care less for my face and focus more of my attention to chit chat with my in-laws last Sunday. I skipped foundation and just apply loose powder especially when I learned that we will spend some time in MOA after lunch. I don't know if it just me but sea breeze makes my face more oily and sticky feel. I really hate it! So I made sure I'll be less conscious of my face that day. I rocked a no make-up look and for me not to get bothered of reapplying blush, AVON lip & cheek tint saved me and kept my cheeks blushed like it's been pinched all day. I also opted to apply just a lip liner to keep the whole look as natural as possible. And of course, loads of Shu Uemura mascara! Before I end this post, let me share with you some photos on how my day went. Meet the man behind the lens - my husband. Before we headed home, we were able to hear the Sunday mass. As usual, the people in the church overflowed down the road. There are so many people outside and even across SMX. We just stood by our car and heard the mass from where we parked in front of SMX Convention Center. So, that's it for now. I hope you all had a great weekend, too. I follow you, I follow?? Wow Jenniya! You look so great! you actually look like you're wearing a make-up! Beautiful look!! you are so pretty!!! Lovely pictures!

One option is to use a setting spray or powder to help keep your makeup in place. You can also try using a primer or moisturizer that has oil-control properties. Additionally, you can try using a powder or blotting papers to absorb any excess oil throughout the day.\n\nIt's also worth noting that everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person may not work for another. It may take some trial and error to find the best solution for your skin type and the specific conditions you're dealing with.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}

{"id": 83, "prompt": "What is the \"mini-maze\" procedure?", "completion": "The \"mini-maze\" procedure is a minimally invasive surgical technique used to treat atrial fibrillation, a common type of heart arrhythmia. During the procedure, a surgeon makes a small incision in the chest and uses specialized tools to create a pattern of scar tissue in the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) that disrupts the abnormal electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe mini-maze procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia and can take several hours to complete. It is considered a type of open-heart surgery, but it is less invasive than traditional open-heart surgery procedures such as the Maze procedure, which requires a larger incision and more extensive surgery.\n\nThe mini-maze procedure is typically recommended for patients who are not candidates for other types of treatment, such as medication or catheter ablation. It is generally considered a safe and effective treatment option for atrial fibrillation, but it does carry some risks, including bleeding, infection, and stroke.\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, the mini-maze procedure carries some"}
{"id": 84, "prompt": "If God is all powerful, can he create a rock so big that even he cannot lift it?", "completion": "This question is a classic philosophical puzzle known as the paradox of omnipotence. The paradox arises because the concept of \"all-powerful\" implies that God can do anything that is logically possible, including creating a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it.\n\nHowever, if God cannot create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it, then he is not all-powerful, because there is something he cannot do. On the other hand, if he can create such a rock, then he cannot lift it, which means he is not all-powerful.\n\nTherefore, the paradox suggests that the concept of \"all-powerful\" is logically incoherent, and cannot be reconciled with the idea of a being that is limited by anything, including the laws of logic.\n\nSome theologians and philosophers have suggested that God's omnipotence does not mean that he can do anything that is logically possible, but rather that he can do anything that is logically consistent with his nature as a perfect being. In this view, the paradox of omnipotence does not arise, because there is no logical contradiction"}

{"id": 91, "prompt": "Explain why the sum of the interior angles of a triangle always adds up to 180 degrees.", "completion": "The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees because of the definition of a triangle. A triangle is a three-sided polygon where any two sides form an angle and the third side connects the two angles to form a straight line. By definition, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, where a is the length of the first side, b is the length of the second side, and c is the length of the third side. The three interior angles of the triangle are formed where two sides meet, and these angles add up to 180 degrees.\n\nFor example, if the first angle is 30 degrees, the second angle is 60 degrees, and the third angle is 90 degrees, then the sum of the interior angles is 30 + 60 + 90 = 180 degrees. This is true for any triangle, regardless of its size or shape.\n\nThe reason for this is that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is equal to the sum of the angles of a straight line. In"}

This research is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.\n\nOne promising approach is to use quantum entanglement, which is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that their properties become correlated, even when they are separated by large distances. By exploiting quantum entanglement, it may be possible to transmit information between computers using photons, which could potentially lead to faster and more secure communication.\n\nAnother approach is to use quantum teleportation, which is a process where the quantum state of one particle is transferred to another particle, even if they are separated by large distances. This could potentially be used to transmit information between computers without the need for physical wires.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these are still emerging technologies, and there are many technical challenges that need to be overcome before they can be widely used.

It is generated by the wings of an aircraft, which create a difference in air pressure above and below the wing. According to Bernoulli's principle, as the speed of a fluid (in this case, air) increases, the pressure of the fluid decreases. The wing of an aircraft is designed to create this difference in air pressure, causing the air to flow faster over the top of the wing, generating lift.\n\nThrust is the forward force that propels an aircraft through the air.

you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring\n(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you\n(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do\n(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one\n(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say\n(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of\n(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail\n(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give\n(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making\n(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud\n(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never\n(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors\n(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]", "completion": "In this YouTube video, Kerwin Rae discusses the importance of chasing one's

However, what many people may not realize is that this seemingly simple act is actually deeply meaningful and has a profound utility.\n\nAt its core, pointing and laughing is a divine act. It is a way of expressing disapproval, ridicule, or mockery towards something or someone. It is a way of saying \"this is not acceptable\" or \"this is not worthy of respect.\" And in this way, it is a powerful tool for shaping and maintaining societal norms and values.\n\nBut pointing and laughing is not just about enforcing social norms. It is also a way of connecting with others and forming a sense of community. When we point and laugh together, we are expressing a shared sense of humor and a shared understanding of what is funny or ridiculous. This can bring people together and create a sense of camaraderie and belonging.\n\nFurthermore, pointing and laughing can be a form of catharsis.

They will probe the atmosphere during the descent, and return the first ever data on electrical fields at the surface of Mars.\nThe EDM Entry, descent, and landing Demonstrator Module is part of the joint ESA/NASA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission to be launched in 2016 for arrival at Mars nine months later.\nAlthough its main goal is to demonstrate European entry, descent and landing technologies for future visits to Mars, it will also offer some limited, but useful, scientific opportunities.\nFor the descent phase, two proposed investigations called Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) Science and IDEAS (Investigations During Entry and Atmospheric Science) were selected and combined into one Entry and Descent Science programme.\nThe joint team will use the module’s entry, descent and landing engineering data to reconstruct its trajectory and determine the atmospheric conditions.\nOnce on the surface, the DREAMS (Dust characterisation, Risk assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) scientific payload will function as an environmental station for the two to four days of the surface mission.\nTo achieve this, teams of scientists and engineers from nine countries around the world will develop a dedicated suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction (MetWind), humidity (MetHumi), pressure (MetBaro) and surface temperature (MarsTem), and to determine the transparency of the atmosphere (ODS).\nDREAMS will also make the first measurements of electrical fields at the planet’s surface with its MicroARES detector. Electrical fields are likely to be generated when grains rub against each other in the dust-rich atmosphere, so landing during the dust storm season increases the chance of being able to study this charging and its consequences.\nIn addition to the surface payload, a colour camera system on the EDM will deliver valuable additional scientific data, as well as spectacular images. No design has yet been chosen for the camera, but a decision is expected before the end of this year.\nThe story was originally published by ESA here.", "completion": "The colour camera system on the EDM (Entry, Descent, and Landing Demonstrator) of the ExoMars mission will provide scientific data and images of the Martian surface during the landing and surface mission phase. The camera will measure the wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure, and surface temperature, as well as determine the transparency of the atmosphere, and make the first measurements of electrical fields at the planet's surface. The camera will also deliver spectacular images of the Martian surface. The design of the camera is expected to be chosen before the end of 2019. The story was originally published by ESA."}

{"id": 197, "prompt": "what's the scientific reason that doctors have bad handwriting", "completion": "There is no one scientific reason why doctors often have poor handwriting. However, there are several factors that may contribute to this phenomenon:\n\n1. Medical training: Medical students spend long hours studying and memorizing complex medical terminology and anatomical diagrams, which can lead to a focus on accuracy and detail over handwriting legibility.\n2. Time constraints: Doctors often have limited time to write prescriptions, orders, and other notes, which can lead to rushed and illegible handwriting.\n3. Handwriting style: Some doctors may have handwriting styles that are naturally difficult to read, such as writing too small or too quickly.\n4. Technology: The widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other digital tools has reduced the need for doctors to write legibly, as they can type their notes and prescriptions directly into a computer.\n\nOverall, poor handwriting is a common issue that can arise from a combination of factors related to medical training, time constraints, personal writing style, and technology."}
