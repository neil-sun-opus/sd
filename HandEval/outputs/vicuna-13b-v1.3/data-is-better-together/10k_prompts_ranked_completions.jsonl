It is often seen as a weakness, but it is actually a strength. Being vulnerable means being open and honest about our feelings, thoughts, and experiences. It allows us to connect with others on a deeper level and build stronger relationships.\n\nHow has vulnerability affected your life?\n\nEmbracing vulnerability has had a profound impact on my life. It has allowed me to be more authentic and true to myself, which has led to more meaningful relationships and a greater sense of self-awareness.\n\nOne example of this is in my friendships. I used to be very guarded and hesitant to open up to others, but once I started being more vulnerable, I found that I was able to build deeper and more meaningful connections with my friends. I started sharing more of my thoughts and feelings with them, and they were able to do the same with me. This has led to a greater sense of trust and understanding between us.\n\nAnother way that vulnerability has affected my life is in my personal growth. When I am open"}

He argued that the only way to overcome these contradictions and create a more stable and just society was through the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and the establishment of socialism.\n\nIn Marx's view, the state would play a central role in the transition to socialism, by taking control of the means of production and using its power to regulate the economy in the interests of the working class. This would involve the creation of a central bank to manage the money supply and credit, as well as other economic institutions to plan and regulate the economy.\n\nWhile Marx's ideas have influenced the development of some central banking systems, it is important to note that central banking systems can take many different forms and have been developed for a variety of reasons.

The economies of Australia and Canada are similar in important ways. They are both well-endowed with natural resources, adopt similarly open trade policies, have populations in the tens of millions (albeit Canada’s is somewhat larger), and they are both English-speaking. Yet Australia’s trade is roughly half as large, as a share of GDP, as Canada’s. Why should this be the case?\n\n[4 marks]\n\n2. “Workers in less developed countries earn much lower wages than do Australian workers. If Australia allows free imports from those countries, Australian wages will eventually be forced down.” Discuss.\n\n[4 marks]\n\n3. Suppose that wages in Japan are roughly equal to wages in the U.S., yet Japanese wages do not buy as much in goods and services as U.S. wages in their respective countries. Explain the likely reason for this.\n\n[4 marks]\n\nMexico is quite close to the U.S., but it is far from the European Union (EU). So it \nmakes sense that \nit trades largely with the U.S. Brazil is far from both, so its trade is split between the \ntwo. Mexico trades more than Brazil in part because it is so close to a major economy \n(the U.S.) and in part because it is a member of a free trade agreement with a large \neconomy (NAFTA). Brazil is farther away from any large economy and is in a free trade \nagreement with relatively small countries. \n4. The average productivity of labour in Japan and the United States are approximately equal in manufactured goods. However, for services it is much higher in the United States than in Japan. Given that services are mostly non-traded, can the United States still reap a comparative advantage in trading with Japan? Explain. \n\n[4 marks]", "completion": "1. The difference in trade-to-GDP ratio between Australia and Canada can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, Canada has a more diversified economy, with a larger share of its exports coming from sectors such as automobiles, machinery, and processed goods. In contrast, Australia's economy is more reliant on the export of raw materials, such as iron ore and coal, which are less processed and have a lower value-added content. Secondly, Canada has a more extensive network of free trade agreements, which allows it to access markets more easily and reduce trade barriers. Finally, Canada's geographical location provides it with easier access to the US market, which is its largest trading partner.\n2. The argument that workers in less developed countries will force down Australian wages if free imports are allowed is not necessarily true. While it is true that free imports may lead to a decrease in wages in certain sectors, it is also possible that increased competition and specialization in certain industries could lead to an increase in productivity and wages overall. Additionally, the gains from increased access to cheaper goods and services could outweigh any losses in wages.\n3. The reason"}

{"id": 18, "prompt": "How does the author perceive Twinklebear's physical attributes, and how does it relate to their Twin Flame connection? Answer according to: MY TWINKLEBEAR: I’m constantly telling her how beautiful she truly is. Compliments are one of the most extraordinary components of social life. If given right they create so much positive energy that they makes things happen as if by magic. They ease the atmosphere around two people and kindly dispose people to each other. Compliments derive from taking notice of praiseworthy situations…so they are a mark of awareness and consciousness. Once praiseworthy situations are noticed, the awareness needs to be spoken. Compliments are little gifts of love. They are not asked for or demanded. They are powerful gifts. But compliments only work if they are a sincere reflection of what we think, and if they are freely given and not coerced. Compliments backfire if they are not genuine. And faux flattery is usually highly transparent. A false compliment makes the speaker untrustworthy; It raises suspicions about motives. And that can undermine a whole relationship. My Twin Flame, “Twinklebear” Lesley Maclean and I had an interesting discussion today, as we always do. Our talks are engaging, fascinating, and enlightening. They serve as a limelight, on ourselves, as they teach us about ourselves—as this is a featured attribute of the Twin Flame relationship. These gratuitous compliments, definitely fell into the “transparent in motive” category, engendering suspicion and irritation in Twinklebear. Twinklebear describes her reaction to this over the top behavior, as having the reverse effect of what the man desired. She felt the need for more space, the more the man engaged in this type of behavior. Exacerbating Twinklebear’s annoyance, was the man’s disturbing cloying habit of always wanting to “cuddle” with her, seeking reciprocal behavior from Twinks 24/7. Sure, women are famous for craving cuddling, but not all the time. She was hardworking with a job, and a child. She sometimes needed normal “breathing space” after a hard day. So, what does a person do when he or she “needs space?” She withdraws. And so she did. A completely normal reaction. The man’s inability to recognize Twinklebear’s need for normal space, resulted in a loss of respect Twinkelebear had for the man. In every relationship, there is usually a “stronger partner.” In Twinks’ relationship with this other man, she was the stronger partner. In this relationship, the man’s cloying “O.T.T.” compliments, were a symptom of the man’s relative weakness–causing Twinklebear to lose respect for him, and to withdraw from him. This is Primal Males and Females 101. These primal instincts are hardwired into males and females since time immemorial. There should be no surprise in Twinklebear’s reaction to the situation. Her reaction was written in stone, since Neanderthal times. Twinklebear described another relationship, which was on the other end of the spectrum. This other man was such a self absorbed narcissist, that he never complimented Twinklebear—which is hard to believe—if you have eyes and can see what a classic blonde hottie Twinklebear is. This man was incapable of giving, or reciprocating love—acts which would have reached beyond the man’s meager view of himself. However, this other man did not reveal his true nature until much later–when it was too late. This man was also a classic “gaslighter,” a control freak who seemed to need to augment his ego, by subjugating another person’s ego and will. This man was not merely cloyingly and annoying, he was….suffocatingly toxic. Between one man to the other, Twinklebear bounced unknowingly, from one extreme end of the spectrum to the other. These represented meaningless compliments because of their O.T.T. nature—to none. That brings us to Twinklebear and me. With an eye on “compliments,” you have to know that I tell Twinklebear, how beautiful she is, several times day. If I told you that I tell Twinklebear how beautiful she is, perhaps ten to twenty times a day? Would you believe me? Would you think it disingenuous, or untrue? Here’s the thing…. Twinklebear and I think this is totally normal—for us—because these compliments are heartfelt and are acts of compulsion. I face a dilemma here. In order for me to be able to convey what I feel, when I am so overwhelmed by Twinklebear’s physical attributes, then I would no doubt innocently meander into what many would consider—excessiveley explicit detail. But Twinklebear said to me earlier…. Twinklebear is like Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty. With no exaggeration, I see Twinklebear as the most incredibly alluring female in the universe, as compelling as the Greek Goddess, Aphrodite—the goddess of love and beauty. With her classic features and sinfully alluring body (pardon me for salivating here), my God–she is so hot! Aphrodite who? If women re analogous to culinary fare—sweet Twinklebear is the crowning dessert—the delectable cream of the crop, the very pinnacle of primal femininity. But you knew that we being Twin Flames, that our attraction and perception to and of each other, transcends the superficiality of beauty of face and body. There is the element of us seeing deeply into each other, knowing and loving the beauty and familiarity within—the love and familiarity borne of living past lives together as Twin Flame loves. Reincarnated Twin Flames we may be, and the more profound turn-on being what it is because of this—don’t forget that we are also human. As humans who are susceptible to the physical charms of the other, hey—how could I not tell her twenty times a day…. To say that these are “compliments,” is to cheapen and dilute their meaning. Rather, these proclamations of love and heartfelt, emotionally driven proclamations are…. Ahh! What a wonderful memoir. I love you! I think age, had lots to do with it too. When younger, we tend to be swept away with romantic ideals, and so on. .. so now I know what’s genuine. That my dearest sookybear,is you! I know you mean it. You are so kind. Awww..my sweet Twinklebear, yes, you are right. Age does teach us valuable lessons—sometimes the hard way. Now I know what REAL love is also. I’ve never known anything like it.

{"id": 22, "prompt": "It is common knowledge that people get colds and the flu more often in winter, but what causes this? Does it stem from a relation between temperature and the immune system? Or is it caused by human behaviour which is somehow different in winter?", "completion": "The reason why people tend to get colds and the flu more often in winter is not fully understood, but there are several theories that have been proposed.\n\nOne theory is that the cold and dry air in winter can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to infections. This is because the cold air can cause the mucous membranes in the nose and throat to dry out, which can make it easier for viruses to enter the body.\n\nAnother theory is that people tend to spend more time indoors in winter, where they are more likely to be exposed to cold and flu viruses that are spread through the air. This is because the viruses can survive for longer periods of time in cold and dry air, and they can be transmitted more easily when people are in close proximity to each other.\n\nThere is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more susceptible to colds and the flu in winter because of changes in their behavior. For example, people may spend more time indoors, where they are more likely to be exposed to cold and flu viruses. They may also be more likely to engage in activities that can weaken the immune system, such"}

Please use [geology concept] to support your explanation.", "completion": "Deep sea hydrothermal vents are unique environments that are characterized by high temperatures, pressures, and mineral-rich fluids. The chemical composition of these fluids is influenced by the geology of the seafloor, which includes the underlying volcanic activity and the interaction of seawater with rocks and minerals.\n\nThe chemical composition of deep sea hydrothermal fluids is often enriched in elements such as sulfur, iron, and manganese, which are essential for the growth of certain microorganisms. These microorganisms, known as chemolithoautotrophs, are able to use these elements as a source of energy and carbon, allowing them to thrive in the extreme conditions found at hydrothermal vents.\n\nOne example of a chemolithoautotroph that is commonly found at hydrothermal vents is the archaea, which are single-celled microorganisms that lack a nucleus. These archaea are able to use sulfur as a source of energy, and are able to oxidize sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. This process releases energy that is used to produce ATP"}
{"id": 24, "prompt": "How is JavaScript code executed", "completion": "JavaScript code is executed by web browsers or web servers in response to user actions or other events. Here's a brief overview of how JavaScript code is executed:\n\n1. JavaScript code is typically written in a .js file and included in an HTML page using a `<script>` tag.\n2. When the HTML page is loaded by a web browser, the browser's JavaScript engine parses the JavaScript code and creates a representation of the code in memory.\n3. The JavaScript engine then executes the code in response to events, such as user actions or changes to the page's content.\n4. JavaScript code can also be executed on the server-side using Node.js, which allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript.\n5. In addition, JavaScript code can be executed in the context of web workers, which allow developers to run JavaScript code in the background without blocking the main thread.\n\nOverall, JavaScript code is executed in response to events and can be executed in a variety of contexts, including the client-side, server-side, and background threads."}

In this case, the graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges, and we know that no vertex is connected to more than 3 other vertices.\n\nOne way to assess the connectivity of the graph is to use the concept of a minimum cut. A cut in a graph is a partition of its vertices into two disjoint subsets. The minimum cut of a graph is the cut that separates the largest number of vertices from the rest of the graph.\n\nIn this case, we can start by removing any edge from the graph, and then count the number of connected components that result. If we remove an edge that connects two vertices that are already in the same connected component, then the number of connected components will not change. On the other hand, if we remove an edge that connects two vertices that are in different connected components, then the number of connected components will increase by one.\n\nBy removing edges one by one, we can find the minimum cut of the graph.

{"id": 65, "prompt": "How was your weekend? Last Sunday, I had a wonderful sundate with my in-laws together with my hubby. It was like a post Valentine date for all of us. We had lunch in Seaside Market (or mostly known as Dampa) along Macapagal Avenue in Pasay City. Many waiters approached and called our attention as we passed by each restaurant (if you've been there, you know what I meant of this usual scenario) but we still chose to eat in the restaurant where we had eaten before because it is more spacious there. Oh we really enjoyed the quick buying of fresh sea foods from the market stalls right across the restaurant, did some bargaining and of course, the sumptuous lunch of fresh cooked sea foods! When it was cooked and finally served all in the table, we were surprised because there are so many that we all struggle to finish what we ordered. Haha! If you are my follower on Instagram and Twitter, then you must have seen the photo I posted using the front camera of my iPhone but yeah, I know the photo didn't give much justice on what I was claiming of no make-up look. So, lovelies, here was my look. I set Sunday for my skin to breathe. So I care less for my face and focus more of my attention to chit chat with my in-laws last Sunday. I skipped foundation and just apply loose powder especially when I learned that we will spend some time in MOA after lunch. I don't know if it just me but sea breeze makes my face more oily and sticky feel. I really hate it! So I made sure I'll be less conscious of my face that day. I rocked a no make-up look and for me not to get bothered of reapplying blush, AVON lip & cheek tint saved me and kept my cheeks blushed like it's been pinched all day. I also opted to apply just a lip liner to keep the whole look as natural as possible. And of course, loads of Shu Uemura mascara! Before I end this post, let me share with you some photos on how my day went. Meet the man behind the lens - my husband. Before we headed home, we were able to hear the Sunday mass. As usual, the people in the church overflowed down the road. There are so many people outside and even across SMX. We just stood by our car and heard the mass from where we parked in front of SMX Convention Center. So, that's it for now. I hope you all had a great weekend, too. I follow you, I follow??

A triangle is a three-sided polygon where any two sides intersect at a angle and the third side, called the hypotenuse, is the side opposite the right angle.\n\nIn a triangle, the sum of the angles at any vertex (corner) is always 180 degrees. This is because the sum of the angles in a triangle must always be 180 degrees, and the angles at each vertex add up to this total.\n\nFor example, in a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, the sum of the angles at vertex A is 360 degrees, since it has three angles. However, since one of these angles is a right angle (90 degrees), the other two angles must add up to 180 degrees.

These principles include lift, thrust, weight, and drag, as well as key scientific concepts such as Bernoulli's principle, Newton's laws of motion, and the properties of air.\n\nLift is the force that allows an aircraft to fly. It is generated by the shape of the wings and the movement of air over them. According to Bernoulli's principle, as the speed of a fluid (such as air) increases, the pressure of the fluid decreases. This principle explains how lift is generated: as air flows over the wings of an aircraft, it speeds up and the pressure decreases, creating a lower pressure area under the wing. This lower pressure area creates an upward force, known as lift, which opposes the weight of the aircraft and allows it to fly.\n\nThrust is the force that propels an aircraft forward. It is generated by the engines of the aircraft and is typically directed rearward, towards the tail of the aircraft. Thrust is what allows an aircraft to accelerate and maintain its speed.\n\nWeight is the force that pulls"}

you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors they were climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system it's not how much money you make it's how you make your money so I've had businesses where I've made millions of dollars but I wasn't doing what I loved so I wasn't happy when I first got into business when I first had the desiring\n(00:20) and businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you\n(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do\n(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one\n(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say\n(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of\n(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail\n(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give\n(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making\n(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud\n(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never\n(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors\n(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you [Music]", "completion": "The speaker, Kerwin Rae, discusses the importance of chasing one's purpose rather than money. He shares his personal experience of initially focusing on making money but realizing that it did not bring him happiness.

They will probe the atmosphere during the descent, and return the first ever data on electrical fields at the surface of Mars.\nThe EDM Entry, descent, and landing Demonstrator Module is part of the joint ESA/NASA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission to be launched in 2016 for arrival at Mars nine months later.\nAlthough its main goal is to demonstrate European entry, descent and landing technologies for future visits to Mars, it will also offer some limited, but useful, scientific opportunities.\nFor the descent phase, two proposed investigations called Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) Science and IDEAS (Investigations During Entry and Atmospheric Science) were selected and combined into one Entry and Descent Science programme.\nThe joint team will use the module’s entry, descent and landing engineering data to reconstruct its trajectory and determine the atmospheric conditions.\nOnce on the surface, the DREAMS (Dust characterisation, Risk assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) scientific payload will function as an environmental station for the two to four days of the surface mission.\nTo achieve this, teams of scientists and engineers from nine countries around the world will develop a dedicated suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction (MetWind), humidity (MetHumi), pressure (MetBaro) and surface temperature (MarsTem), and to determine the transparency of the atmosphere (ODS).\nDREAMS will also make the first measurements of electrical fields at the planet’s surface with its MicroARES detector. Electrical fields are likely to be generated when grains rub against each other in the dust-rich atmosphere, so landing during the dust storm season increases the chance of being able to study this charging and its consequences.\nIn addition to the surface payload, a colour camera system on the EDM will deliver valuable additional scientific data, as well as spectacular images. No design has yet been chosen for the camera, but a decision is expected before the end of this year.\nThe story was originally published by ESA here.", "completion": "The colour camera system on the EDM (Entry, Descent, and Landing Demonstrator Module) of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission will provide scientific data and images of the Martian surface during the descent and landing phase. The camera will measure the wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure, and surface temperature, and determine the transparency of the atmosphere. Additionally, it will capture high-resolution images of the landing site, which will be valuable for future mission planning and scientific analysis. The camera design is expected to be chosen before the end of 2019."}

{"id": 197, "prompt": "what's the scientific reason that doctors have bad handwriting", "completion": "There is no one scientific reason why doctors often have poor handwriting. However, there are a few factors that may contribute to this phenomenon.\n\nOne possible reason is that doctors are trained to write quickly and efficiently in order to keep up with the demands of their profession. This may lead to a more hasty and sloppy handwriting style, as they prioritize getting their thoughts down on paper over the legibility of their writing.\n\nAnother factor may be the use of shorthand or abbreviations, which can be necessary in medical settings to save time and space on charts and prescriptions. However, these abbreviations can be difficult to decipher for those who are not familiar with medical terminology, leading to confusion and potential errors.\n\nAdditionally, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) has become increasingly common in recent years, which may have reduced the need for doctors to write as much by hand. This could lead to a decline in handwriting skills over time, as they are not practiced as frequently.\n\nOverall, there is no single scientific explanation for why doctors often have poor handwriting, but a combination of factors may contribute to this phenomenon."}
